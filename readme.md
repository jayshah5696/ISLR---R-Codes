# An Introduction to Statistical Learning - Code Snippets

Statistical Learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex dataset.
These codes are from book ISLR and their exercise.
Play with it at your will.

## Chapters from ISLR and corresponding codes

1.  Introduction
1.  Statistical Learning
1.  Linear Regression
1.  Classification - (classification_logistics.R, Classification_book_Logisitic.R, Classification_book_LDA.R)
1.  Resampling Methods - (cross Validation.R)
1.  Linear Model Selection and Regularization - (subset selection 6-1.R, ridge and lasso 6-2.R)
1.  Moving Beyond Linearity
1.   Tree - Based Methods - (cart_bagging.R, tree.R, tree_book.R)
1.  Support Vector Machines - (svc.R)
1.  Unsupervised Learning - (unsupervised.Rmd, pca.R)




## Future Goals

- ISLR Python codes :
  I am currently working on a small project where I am building tutorial for the ISLR in Python.
  Originally, It's only for R but you will have the chance to apply these same in Python.

- Keep in Touch :
  Let, me know if you need any other code Snippets.

Thank You!
